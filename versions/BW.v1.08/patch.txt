--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- patch 1.08
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Adds support for a new template "Top vs Bottom". This template functions
  like Melee, with the exception that players in each half are automatically
  allied and share vision at game start, thus removing the "who am I allied
  with" question (and reducing the amount of clicking done after the game
  starts). The game creator can move players around between the two sides as
  needed to assign teams properly. Note that Top vs Bottom only works for
  games with two sides - if you want to play 2x2x2 games, you will still need
  to use Melee.

- Adds support for Game Recording. When a game is over, there will be a new
  button "Save Replay" in the victory/defeat screen. If you save a replay, you
  can watch it at a future date. Replays are saved to the "replay" folder inside
  your Maps folder. Create a game and pick your replay from the "replay" folder.
  A replay is always passworded. Up to 7 other people can your your replay game
  to watch it with you; chat is from the people currently connected to the
  replay game. Replay files can be transferred to other people automatically
  (if someone joins your replay game, they get your replay transferred to them
  via the automatic map download facility), or you can copy your replay files
  (replays end in .REP) from your "replay" folder to a desired destination
  manually. See www.blizzard.com\starcraft\replay for more information.

- Adds support for gateway selection. You can now specify which Battle.net
  cluster to connect to. In normal cases, you will do nothing, and you will
  be sent to the "closest" Battle.net cluster. If you wish to override the
  automatic selection, you can pick a cluster manually.

- Save Game clarification - the save game window now shows:
    Saving Multiplayer Game
    Save Game Name:  XXX
  in order to avoid the "Saving Starcraft Virus 1.0 to Hard Disk" joke. 

- If you are really clever, you can crush tanks by landing buildings on them.
  This is the unexpected consequence to fixing a cheeze that allowed players
  to have siege tanks underneath barracks.

- Better proxy support
- Clearer battle.net messages.
- Updated "Connecting to fastest server" messages to be clearer.
- Ladders maps updated.
- Ladder cheating fix - Ladder map alteration fix (Japanese version, too!)
- Fixed various language translation problems.
