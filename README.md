# SCV Selector

SCV Selector can efficiently switch your StarCraft / StarCraft: Brood War game installation between any version from 1.00 to 1.16.1. It was designed to avoid the compatibility issues associated with different versions, helping to play LAN games and view old replays.

It was created using the versatile and beloved installation tool, [NSIS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/). This is an old project from over 10 years ago; I am now publishing the source code for reference.
